### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 

As a computer science and mathematics student with experience in data engineering and machine learning, I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I have interned at  Meta, where I worked on state-of-the-art neural networks models and developed features pipelines for prediction models. In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong leader and team player, as demonstrated by my role as Director of Diversity and Equity at Eastern Oregon University. I am excited to continue learning and growing in my career, and am always looking for new opportunities to make an impact
